# Fly's Brain Drivers Design System
## Background
<p>Inducing a specific protein into a single neuron in Drosophila relies on utilizing an upstream enhancer to drive downstream gene expression. Nowadays, many drivers in Drosophila have been developed and contributed to researches in neuroscience. Typically, they contained an upstream enhancer and a common promoter to initiate the transcription. In this way, these drivers can express proteins in targeted neurons. However, these strains of Drosophila, such as Flylight or VDRC, are not perfect. They hardly label a single neuron and are usually dirty. Thus, whether we could design specific drivers that are clean enough remains unclear.</p>
  
<p>To understand the corresponding relationship between enhancer sequences and report genes' expression in the brain and design our specific drivers, we tried several models and algorithms using deep learning to predict the expression pattern of reporter genes based on enhancer sequence features. Ideally, our system will learn how drivers work in fly's brain and can help us design specifc drivers.</p>

## Our Work
### Autoencoder
<p>Firstly, We implemented autoencoder to encode DNA sequences and VAE to encode images from confocal microscopes.</p>

### Machine Learning
## Future Plan
