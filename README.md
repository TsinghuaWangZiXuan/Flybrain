# Flybrain
## Background
<p>Introducing a specific protein into a single neuron in Drosophila relies on utilizing an upstream enhancer to drive
particular gene expression. To understand the corresponding relation between enhancer sequence and cell type in the
brain, I designed several Image Captioning algorithms using deep learning to predict the expression pattern of reporter
genes based on enhancer sequence features.</p>
