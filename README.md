# Fly's Brain Drivers Design System
## Background
<p>Introducing a specific protein into a single neuron in Drosophila relies on utilizing an upstream enhancer to drive
particular gene expression. To understand the corresponding relationship between enhancer sequences and cells in the
brain and design our specific drivers, we tried several models and algorithms using deep learning to predict the expression pattern of reporter
genes based on enhancer sequence features. Ideally,</p>
